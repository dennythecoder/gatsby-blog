He was a commanding figure that exuded charisma.  Even without the uniform, that would have been recognizable.  He spoke very well and mentioned the Administration's ongoing engagements.

One thing that he brought up with some vigor was Don't Ask Don't Tell, the policy that disallows discussion of homosexuality.  They're looking to possibly repeal the policy.  I hope they get traction with the repeal.  Although discussions of a sexual matter should be tempered, they shouldn't be more so because of the participants.  Should the Profession of Arms consist of people that are seen as professionals?
