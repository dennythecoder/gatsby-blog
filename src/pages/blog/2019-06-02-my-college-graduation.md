# Higher Education...

is not always seen that way.  There is a sufficiently large pool of low-quality individuals that still find themselves with degrees from universities more prestigious than mine.  That said, having the degree won't generally disqualify you.

## I should have done CompSci...

but it would have been more challenging to complete that with the same blistering pace.  During one 2-month term, I was enrolled in and completed 6 courses with all As.  

## This is a win...

but I should have done it much sooner.  Aiden, if you ever read this... finish schoool then figure things out.
