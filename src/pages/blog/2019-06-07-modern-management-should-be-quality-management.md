title: Modern Management should be Quality Management

  Within the Air Force, uniformed personnel are appraised through Enlisted (or
  Officer) Performance Reports. The implication of the naming for such documents
  is that we're measured based upon performance. However, this simply is not the
  case. Anything less than a perfect rating requires significant documentation.
  With this being the case, it is difficult to truly discern who is performing
  at a higher level. Furthermore, one negative appraisal may negatively impact
  the next one.

In the past couple of years, I've observed the strange case of an Airman that apparently upset someone in the chain of command. I saw her be written up after leaving a phone number on a post-it on her desk and missing an appointment after being placed on quarters (this is when a doctor tells you that you're too sick to work). Based on these two incidents, the appraisal marked down significantly for one year. The following year, the appraisal score was not allowed to be normalized because of the previous score.

Stories like this one are common, and there are only one or two people in the process that can make a meaningful difference. Unfortunately, I was not one of those two people in this case.

# How can this be fixed?

The principles of quality management as it pertains to project management should be used in a similar manner. Give reports SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, timely) goals and mark their progress towards these goals. 

Why's this difficult? Such concepts are already recommended but managers are not held accountable for implementing them. Many bright Airmen are being punished for what amounts to a lack of chemistry between themselves and their supervisors.

As a manager, myself, I must strive to not fall into the same errors of mismanagement. I should always strive towards objectivity regardless of how difficult it is to attain.
