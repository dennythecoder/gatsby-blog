  CompTIA markets itself as the "voice of the world's IT Passing CompTIA A+,
  Security+ Testsindustry". While that is highly debatable, it's apparent the
  United States Government has relied upon their certifications to establish a
  baseline of knowledge that IT professionals working for the Government should
  have, contracted personnel included.

If you're looking to do IT work for the U.S. DoD, you should head over to https://public.cyber.mil/cwmp/dod-approved-8570-baseline-certifications/. The page features a table derived from DoD policy. 
There are many resources for test prep. If your company or organization is willing to pay for it, I highly recommend attending an in-person bootcamp. This will not only allow you to get feedback to specific questions, but allow you to study in an environment free of distractions.
A couple of in-person vendors that I've received training from include:
Global Knowledge - https://www.globalknowledge.com
New Horizons - https://nhlearninggroup.com
Take this with a grain of salt, though, as I am only speaking on the my personal experience.
## Organization Doesn't Want to Pay for Training?
I've seen this quote attributed to multiple people:
A CFO asks a CEO: What happens if we invest in developing our people and then they leave us?
The CEO responds: What happens if we don't and they stay?
Based on my experience, organizations that invest more in workforce development find that the workforce tends to hang out longer.
# Cheap Alternatives
Sometimes you want to learn something out of scope or you simply need to take matters into your own hands. For these DoD certs, I've found the following resources to be useful for standalone studying and/or supplementing other resources.
## Udemy 
I am in love with this site. For variety, quality, and price of content, Udemy is my favorite. I've used the site to get acquainted with software libraries, study for A+, Sec+, PMP certifications, and stuff that I simply want to learn more about.
## Professor Messer
Free videos for A+, Net+, Sec+ and more. 
## Cybrary
This company offers a series of limited (but free) courses to prepare you for CompTIA exams and more.
# What do certs accomplish?
The value of many certifications is highly debatable, but having them will rarely close any doors.  If you're looking to get hired by a defense contractor, it's in your best interest to get an adequate certification ahead of time.
